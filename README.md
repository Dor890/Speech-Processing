# Speech Recognition and Processing
Written by: Dor Messica, Roi Zehavi.

This repository contains a collection of exercises and a final project focused on speech processing and recognition. The exercises cover a range of topics, including Fourier transforms, MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), Mel spectrograms, audio and music classification, DTW, DNN-HMM and more.

## Exercise 1
In Exercise 1, we have explored Fourier transforms, MFCC, Mel spectrograms, and basic audio handling and manipulation techniques. This exercise serves as a foundation for understanding speech processing and recognition. It covers fundamental concepts and techniques that are widely used in the field.

## Exercise 2
Exercise 2 focuses on music classification using different features. We implemented there logistic regression from scratch to build a music classifier. This exercise provides hands-on experience with implementing a machine learning algorithm and applying it to the task of music classification. By completing this exercise, we have gained insights into feature selection and classification techniques.


## Exercise 3
In Exercise 3, We delved into digit audio classification. This exercise specifically uses MFCC and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) to build a classifier for recognizing spoken digits. By working on this exercise, We have gained practical knowledge of applying MFCC and DTW in the context of speech recognition.


## Exercise 4
Exercise 4 is currently in progress and will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned for the latest updates!


## Final Project
The final project is still under development and will be added to the repository shortly.


## Conclusion
We hope this repository provides you with a valuable learning experience in speech processing and recognition. The exercises are designed to cover key concepts and techniques, allowing you to gain hands-on experience with various aspects of speech-related tasks. Feel free to explore the exercises, experiment with the code, and expand your knowledge in this exciting field!

Happy coding!
